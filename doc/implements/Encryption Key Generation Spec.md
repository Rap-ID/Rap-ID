The Algorithm
-----

This is the hash algorithm for the key generation. The hash method contains the following steps:

1. Get *the original seed* of any length
2. Get the `MD5` hash of *the original seed*
3. Append *the encryption seed*( `enc_seed = md5(md5( floor( timestamp() / 60 ))`) to the hash value got in the last step
4. Do `MD5` again
5. Use the first 64 bits as the key

Specification
-----

In the pair step of the Rap-ID authentication algorithm, *the original seed* in plain base-16 string is:

```
CF166A138A5B6AD5
```

In the authentication step of the Rap-ID authentication algorithm, *the original seed* is generated by the following steps:

1. Get the *username* and *password* of current user
2. Do as the code shows: `md5(md5(username)+md5(password)+md5(enc_seed))`, `+` means append
