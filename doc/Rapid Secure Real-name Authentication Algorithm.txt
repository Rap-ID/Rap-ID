Abstract

In people’s daily life, there are increasing conditions needing user authentication,
but the existing methods are not user-friendly or not enough secure, or requiring
extra hardwares which may cause charges. Additionally, China government is pushing
real-name internet into action, so it is quite vital to find a method which provides
a low-cost and is easy to take into action without using ID card readers. For the two
reasons above, we come up with a algorithm providing rapid secured authentication which
also solves the problem of acting real-name internet. The algorithm relies on intranet
communication between mobile phone, which is taken as hardware token, and computers and
uses token-passing mechanism to provide the environment where the end-user only have to
click a button to finish authentication. It also uses rolling-password mechanism and
pairing system to provide a relatively secure condition. Besides, using the real-name
information filled in when registering a phone number and the ICCID of SIM card in users’
phones, the internet actions is real-named as well as secured . Nowadays, nearly every
internet user own a mobile phone and a personal home network, thus the algorithm is
low-cost and acceptable by people. Meanwhile, API and SDK is provided with the algorithm,
so it is realistic for third-party applications to adapt into it. It can be used in normal
logging-in, real-name payment, registering of net bar, etc. We released the source codes
and API documents and SDKs on GitHub.
