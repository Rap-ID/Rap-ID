Rap-ID
=====

Overview
-----
As now there're increasing conditions requiring authentication and personal identity,
`Rap-ID` provides an algorithm which uses less user inputs but provides even more
security and features.

It's based on communicating between PC and mobile phones, taking the phone as a
hardware token and ICCID as a media of real-name identity.
